Bank's internal approach to assess capital adequacy

prepared on the basis of current and projected capital adequacy. Bank's plan and	

investment decision is based on at what level of capital adequacy it wants to remain at.	

Risk Management Function	


Risk Assessment/Mitigation Practices at Kumari Bank Limited	

Considering the need to establish effective Risk Management and Risk Mitigation	

practices at Kumari Bank Ltd, we have developed a system of continuous improvement	

of processes wherein each member of the Bank works towards balancing profitability	

with prudence. The system encompasses all banking functions from client interface, to	

back office operation, to the strategic decision formulated by the management	

committees and the Board of Directors. Each area has its own check and balance	

procedure to assess and mitigate risks involved. The practices thus observed are as	

follows:	

KBL Organization Structure	

The bank's lending approval authority is divided into two distinct units, namely	

Business and Risk Management. While the Business Unit concentrates more on	

optimum utility of assets, every lending decision of this Unit is re-assessed and	

revaluated by the Risk Management Unit for final approval. The Risk Management Unit	

applies its objective judgment on risk variables deemed appropriate in each instance of	

lending decision. For this purpose, the Risk Management Unit has two distinct subunits,	

the Risk Approval Department, which facilities final lending decision after duly	

adjusting risks as mitigated to an acceptable level, and the Credit Administration and	

Control Department, which evaluates the endorsed paperwork prior to actual sanction,	

and also after it.	

Depending upon the volume of loans and the nature of risk associated, lending decision	

are subject to validation and approval by various levels of the hierarchy, in which some	

lending decision are to be approved by the General Manager, and other by even the	

Board of Directors as each case may require.	

Risk Measurement Criteria and Mitigation Process	

Credit risks are evaluated from the initial customer interface on an array of risk variables	

by the Credit Policy Guidelines of the Bank, as well as on the individual intuition of	

experienced officers. As proposals are escalated for approval, judgmental and analytical	

criteria become broader and more conceptual.	

Kumari Bank Ltd. uses the best practices in banking, to make its operation secure	

through a system of procedural crosschecking mechanism in each operational	

transaction. An Internal Audit Department, which also doubles as the Concurrent Audit	

Department system, continuously functions to alert bank personnel to the	

meticulousness required in handling operations in every functional department. A credit	

monitoring system is well established in the Bank, which periodically checks on credit	

quality, compliance, and level of risk exposure. This practice has created a continuous	

learning and improvement environment, and the Bank's efficiency goal has been to	

move towards the most prudent practices in the industry.
