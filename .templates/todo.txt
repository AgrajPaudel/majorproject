first, define the range for all the variables and risks and outliers and predict risks based on them
either predict using given ratios or your own made up ratio
risk weights, every variables have weights and then classify based on them weights on either risky or not, good variables give positive, bad give -ve, bad is risk while good reduces risks.
only ratios no solid values
risks calculated based on z scores
all time health vs that instance health vs all time that bank health
